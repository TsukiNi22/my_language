Global Description:
    - Any comparator take the value before and compare it with the value just after
    - They return a boolean value represented by 0 and 1, respectively false and true

'>':
    description:
        - The ouput is 1 when the first value is greater than the second value
        - The ouput is 0 when the first value is less than the second value or equal

    syntax:
        a > b

'>=':
    description:
        - The ouput is 1 when the first value is greater than the second value or equal
        - The ouput is 0 when the first value is less than the second value

    syntax:
        a >= b

'<':
    description:
        - The ouput is 1 when the first value is less than the second value
        - The ouput is 0 when the first value is greater than the second value or equal

    syntax:
        a < b

'<=':
    description:
        - The ouput is 1 when the first value is less than the second value or equal
        - The ouput is 0 when the first value is greater than the second value

    syntax:
        a <= b

'==':
    Description:
        - The value is 1 when the first and the second value are equal on the value
        - The value is 0 when the first and the second value are different

    Syntax:
        a == b

'===':
    Description:
        - The value is 1 when the first and the second value are equal on the value and the type
        - The value is 0 when the first and the second value are different

    Syntax:
        a === b

'!=':
    Description:
        - The value is 1 when the first and the second value are different on the value
        - The value is 0 when the first and the second value are equal

    Syntax:
        a != b

'!==':
    Description:
        - The value is 1 when the first and the second value are different on the value or the type
        - The value is 0 when the first and the second value are equal

    Syntax:
        a !== b

'~=':
    Description:
        - The precision can be changed with the key word 'comp_prec' // maybe not sure for this sentence
        - The value is 1 when the first value is slightly different or equal the second with a precision of 10^(-1)
        - The value is 0 when the first and the second value are different for more than 10^(-1)

    Syntax:
        a ~= b

'&&':
    description:
        - The ouput is 1 when both the first value and the second value are different than 0 (equivalent to false)
        - The ouput is 0 when at least the first value or the second value is equal to 0 (equivalent to false)

    syntax:
        a && b

'||':
    description:
        - The ouput is 1 when at least the first value or the second value is different than 0 (equivalent to false)
        - The ouput is 0 when both the first value and the second value are equal to 0 (equivalent to false)

    syntax:
        a || b
