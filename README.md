### My own programming language "c15" with his compiler "kamion" or "kmc" standing for KaMion Compiler
## Language Description

The name "c15" has nothing to do with the `C` programming language, this is a private joke like the name of the compiler

This language is based on the `C`, with some difference and some other thing in more, i designed it has how i wanted it to be and with what i wanted.

There probably a bunch of bug, if you find one and want to contribute send me someting here (c15.tsukini@gmail.com)

| File extension | Utility                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.15`          | for the code                                           |
| `.15h`         | for prototype, set, .. (code can also be writen in it) |

## How use/install the compiler
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TsukiNi22/my_language.git
```

To create a link to the compiler (On Fedora / or use `ln -s absolute_path_to_kamion.py path_of_the_env_var_path`):
```sh
cd my_language/phyton_version
make
```

To use it or for more information use `-h`:
```sh
kmc files_path
```
